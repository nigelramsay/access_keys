ACCESS KEYS HELPER
------------------

This javascript routine parses the DOM tree looking for buttons and links that have an access key defined. The access keys for these elements are then displayed either:

1. Inside an "access_keys" element (if one exists), or
2. At the bottom of the BODY element, inside a newly created "access_keys" element

REQUIREMENTS

* Prototype

INSTALLATION

1. copy the access_keys.js file into your javascripts folder
2. include a reference to the file inside your HTML

See the demo.html file for example usage.
