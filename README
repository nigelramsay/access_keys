Access Keys helper

This javascript routine parses the DOM tree looking for buttons and links that have an access key defined. The access keys for these elements are then displayed either:

1. Inside an "access_keys" element (if one exists), or
2. At the bottom of the BODY element, inside a newly created "access_keys" element

REQUIREMENTS

* Prototype

INSTALLATION

1. copy the access_keys.js file into your javascripts folder
2. include a reference to the file inside your HTML

See the demo.html file for example usage.
